    "\n",
    "- #### 1) Easy to Learn and Use\n",
    "    - Python is easy syntax to learn and use. It is developer-friendly and high level programming language.\n",
    "- #### 2) Expressive Language\n",
    "    - Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable\n",
    "- #### 3) Interpreted Language\n",
    "    - Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. \n",
    "    - This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.\n",
    "- #### 4) Cross-platform Language\n",
    "  - Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. \n",
    "  - So, we can say that Python is a portable language.\n",
    "- #### 5) Free and Open Source:\n",
    "    - Python is free to download and use.this means that source code is also available to the public.\n",
    "    So you can download it as, use it as well as share it.\n",
    "- #### 6)object oriented:\n",
    "  - Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.\n",
    "- #### 7) Extensible\n",
    "  - It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can \n",
    "    be used further in our python code.\n",
    "- #### 8) Large Standard Library\n",
    "  - Python has a large and broad library and provides rich set of module and functions for \n",
    "    rapid application development.\n",
    "- #### 9) GUI Programming Support\n",
    "  - Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython in python.\n",
    "    PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.\n",
    "- #### 10) Integrated\n",
    "  - It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc."
